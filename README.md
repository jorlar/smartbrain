# SmartBrain - v2.0
Final project for my ZTM course

This app is built along as I completed one of many ZTM-courses. 
Feel free to reuse this code to build your own verision: 

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. You must add your own API key in the `src/App.js` file to connect to Clarifai.
